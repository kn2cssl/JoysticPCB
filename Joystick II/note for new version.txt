on Schematics:
connect the fucking interrupt pin of nrf
delete that fucking led we have a 7-seg already
FPC connector is fucked up on connection of ground pin
NRFschematics ist falch

on PCB:
don't use fucking idiotic angles please
you can make it smaller 
and also remember for cheking polygon on both sides and also it should be as exact size of the board no less no more
remember to put programmer in someplace that you can palce a connector (wire is rubbish as fuck)
